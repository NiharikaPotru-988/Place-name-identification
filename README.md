# Geo-Parsing System

## Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of a **Geo-Parsing System** that automatically identifies geographic terms from unstructured natural language text. The project leverages machine learning techniques to ensure high accuracy and robust performance in extracting geographic information.

## Features
- **Geographic Term Identification**: Extract and classify geographic terms from text.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Differentiate geographic from non-geographic terms using NER techniques.
- **Word Sense Disambiguation**: Utilizes Bayesian classifiers to resolve context-based ambiguities.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Combines Flask for web applications and Tkinter for desktop functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - `spaCy` and `NLTK` for text pre-processing
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Scikit-Learn` for data handling and machine learning
  - `Flask` for web development
  - `Tkinter` for desktop application
- **Testing**: Unit and integration testing for robustness

## Key Achievements
- Achieved 95% accuracy in geographic term identification.
- Enhanced word sense disambiguation using probabilistic methods.
- Processed large datasets efficiently for improved performance.
